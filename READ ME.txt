Program Features:
- Able to code all logic of all required instructions
- Can implement pipeline flush and freeze (for pipeline FREEZE, the stalling is still marked as IF in the pipeline map)
- Was not able to implement the floating point clock cycles (i.e. float instructions still execute in one EX clock cycle)
